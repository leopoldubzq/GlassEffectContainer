# ğŸ“± GlassEffectContainer â€“ iOS 26 SwiftUI Demo

SwiftUI in **iOS 26** introduces a new built-in component: `GlassEffectContainer` ğŸ§Š  
It enables developers to add a glass-like background with beautifully animated content that **smoothly separates and slides out**, creating a subtle depth effect â€“ all with just a few lines of code.

> Previously, building something like this required quite a bit of effort. Now, it's native in SwiftUI ğŸš€

## âœ¨ What is `GlassEffectContainer`?

A new SwiftUI container that:

- Allows content inside to **animate independently**, creating a feeling of separation and motion
- Fits naturally with system styling and dynamic effects
